Podcast Web API
The Podcast Web api is a web audio player specially crafted for listening to podcasts.
Currently using in our <a href="https://besttheme.com/podcast-wordpress-theme/">project</a> for the podcast audio section. The player is extensible and ships with many default extensions. The player is completely themeable, and can change the markup, which comes with a responsive default theme.
<h2>Usage</h2>
By default the player is integrated into the page using a <script> HTML tag. This is necessary to render the player in an iframe to ensure it does not interfere with the enclosing page's CSS and JS while still being able to resize the player interface dynamically.
<h2>Contribute</h2>
